NAME
    Template::Parser::LocalizeNewlines - Drop-in replacement
    Template::Parser that fixes bad newlines

DESCRIPTION
    Template::Parser would seem to have a problem in that PRE_CHOMP and
    friends only work on local newlines. If a Template Toolkit instance on a
    Unix host encounters DOS newlines in a Template, it will fail to chomp
    the newline correctly.

    Template::Parser::LocalizeNewlines is a drop-in replacement that behaves
    EXACTLY the same (and is a subclass of) as a normal parser, except that
    before it goes to parse the template content, it applies the newline
    localisation regex describes in <http://ali.as/devel/newlines.html>.

  Using this Module
    When creating your Template instance, simple pass an instance of this
    object along to the constructor.

METHODS
    This module is identical to Template::Parser.

SUPPORT
    Module not implemented, there's nothing to be broken. But if you have
    installation problems, submit them to the CPAN bug tracker.
