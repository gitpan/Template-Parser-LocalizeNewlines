NAME
    Template::Parser::LocalizeNewlines - Drop-in replacement
    Template::Parser that fixes bad newlines

DESCRIPTION
    Template::Parser has a problem with PRE_CHOMP and related options. They
    only work on local newlines. If a Template Toolkit instance on a Unix
    host encounters DOS newlines in a Template, it will fail to chomp the
    newline correctly, with potentially disasterous results.

    Template::Parser::LocalizeNewlines is a drop-in replacement that behaves
    EXACTLY the same (and is a subclass of) as a normal parser, except that
    before it goes to parse the template content, it applies the newline
    localisation regex describes in <http://ali.as/devel/newlines.html>.

  Using this Module
    When creating your Template instance, simple pass an instance of this
    object along to the constructor.

METHODS
    This module is identical to Template::Parser.
